## üßê Abstract <a name = "abstract"></a>
The purpose of a portfolio website is to showcase a person's or a company's work and skills to potential clients, employers, or collaborators. 
A portfolio website is a digital representation of a person's or a company's past work, projects, and achievements.

Portfolio websites typically contain examples of the individual or company's work, including descriptions of the projects, images, videos, and 
testimonials from previous clients or collaborators. They may also include a brief biography, resume or CV, contact information, and links to social 
media profiles or other relevant websites.
